## üìù Data Cleaning Process
The analysis included several data cleaning steps:

1. Duplicate Removal
   - Created staging table with row numbers for duplicate identification
   - Removed exact duplicate entries

2. Data Standardization
   - Trimmed whitespace from all text fields
   - Standardized company names
   - Verified and cleaned industry categories
   - Normalized location and country data

3. Data Type Conversion
   - Converted date strings to proper DATE format
   - Changed percentage_laid_off to DECIMAL(5,2)
   - Modified total_laid_off to INTEGER
   - Converted funds_raised to BIGINT

4. NULL Value Handling
   - Replaced empty industry values with 'other'
   - Properly handled NULL values in percentage_laid_off
   - Cleaned up empty funds_raised entries
   - Removed rows with no meaningful data (NULL in both total_laid_off and percentage_laid_off)
